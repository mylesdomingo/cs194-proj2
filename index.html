    <h1>Project 2 -- Fun with Filters and Frequencies</h1>
    <p>By Myles Domingo</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we create various constructions using 2D convolutions and
      filtering.
    </p>

    <h2>1.1 Finite Difference Operators</h2>
    <p>
      To calculate the gradient magnitude of our cameraman image, we take the
      partial derivatives in x and y. We convert our image to grayscale and
      convolve it with dx = [1, -1] and dy = [ [1], [-1] ]. This gives us two
      images that showcases horizontal and vertical edges in our image.
    </p>
    <p>
      To render the gradient magnitude image, we take the euclidian distance of
      our partial derivatives, such that gradient = sqrt((dx / df)^2 +
      (dy/df)^2). We binarize the output gradient and set a threshold = 0.20 to
      reduce noise while capturing most of the edges on the image.
    </p>

    <h2>1.2 Derivative of Gaussian Operator</h2>
    <p>
      Our initial implentation of our gradient magnitude image remains noisy. To
      reduce noise, we convolve our original camerman image with a Gaussian
      Filter G, with kernel size = 10 and sigma = 5. When we perform the same
      operations to get our gradient magnitude image, we can see the difference
      in that there is a lot less noise and smooth, fatter edges. We reduce our
      cutoff threshold when we binarize the image to capture a greater amount of
      edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also generate our gradient magnitude image by taking a derivative
      of our Gaussian Filter G and applying it to our image, as they are both
      linear functions.
    </p>

    <h2>1.3 Image Straightening</h2>
    <p>
      We can determine if an image is straight if it has a significant amount of
      vertical or horizontal edges (in most cases). To create an auto
      straightener, we set an angle window [-10, 10] degrees and find the
      optimal angle rotation that yields the largest number of -180, 90, 0, 90,
      180 edges. These edges can be found by calculating atan(dx/df, dy/df).
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent generating new edges when rotating, we center crop 15% of the
      image and count edges within the image. Most input images have worked well
      within the angle window provided; the only cases where this would not work
      is with purposefully slanted objects or necessary rotations outside of the
      angle window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> We see that this is the optimal angle rotation not only
      visually from the images, but also in our histograms. We see that there
      are a significant increase in number of edges at -180, 90, 0, 90 degrees
      after rotation. <b>When assessing, be mindful of the y-scale.</b>

    <h2>2.1 Image Sharpening</h2>
    <p>
      We can sharpen image by creating a low pass filter, subtracting it from
      the original image, and collecting the high frequencies of the image. We
      can add these high frequencies to the original image using the unsharp
      mask filter.

    <h2>2.2 Hybrid Images</h2>

    <p>
      We can create hybrid images that change in interpretation based on viewing
      distances by combining the low pass filter of an image and a high pass
      filter of another. We align the images by dominant features, such as nose
      bridges, eyes, ears, and scale such that these points align with each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also experiement with cutoff ranges by modifying sigma of our Gaussian
      filter to increase/decrease visual dominance of our low and high filters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Bells and Whistles </b> I introduced colors into the hybrid images by
      separating each color channel of the image and performing the convolutions
      for the low-pass and high-pass filters. I personally think it looks better
      for both when the color paletters are somewhat the same â€” otherwise, the
      low frequency component as it provides a sturdy base for the image.

    <div class="image-row">

      <b>Fourier Analysis:</b> Here are frequency analysises in the fourier
      domain of these images. We can see the additive relationship between the

      <b>Note:</b> I consider this image is a <b>failure case.</b> The shapes of
      the face and animals are too compositonally different, and the black of
      eyes of the seal are dominated by the portrait's eyes regardless of sigma
      and viewing distance.

    <h2>2.3 Laplacian and Gaussian Stacks</h2>
    <p>
      We create a Gaussian stack by applying a Gaussian filter across the same
      image multiple times. This removes the need for downsampling an image, and
      can preserve dimensions.
    </p>
    <div class="image-row">
      <div class="image">
        <img src="results/gaussian_stack.png" />
        <p>Gaussian Stack, N = 5 Lincoln</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Failed to create a laplacian stack because I believe my
      implenetation for gaussian stacks are too slow, and takes too much time to
      iterate and calculate the laplacian for each level as a function of the
      gaussian stack. Normally, how this would work is that I would take the
      difference of current and next level of the gaussian stack.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Even if unfinished, I really enjoyed implementing this product. The main
      things Iâ€™ve learned are the vast numerous use cases of a Gaussian filter,
      which can be used with a simple convolution. The main challenge was
      understanding the underlying python libraries, including how to plot
      images, separate color channels, and handle convolutions of arrays of
      different dimensions.
